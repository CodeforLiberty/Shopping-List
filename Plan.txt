Shopping List Sprint Requirements

In terms of user experience, your shopping list app must allow users to:

1. enter items they need to purchase by entering text and hitting "Return" or 
clicking the "Add item" button
 
  Story: Sally is a consumer visiting our site to buildout her list of items she'll purchase from our store front.
  Scope:- She'll enter the listing into an input field.  When she submits, the item  will be placed in a item container to be display on the page.
  API: INVENTORY system & Invoicing system. 
  Pseudo code
    - input field and submit button trigger a submit event
    - hitting return from the input field will also trigger a submit event
    - function to listen for the submit event (preventDefault)
    - get the value from the input 
    - send the value to the addItem method
    - need a render function to display the item container
    - each item container will include check and delete buttons
  LOE: 30mins
  Risks: Inventory API has had reliability issues

2. check and uncheck items on the list by clicking the "Check" button
  Story: Sally wants to cross items off the list after she gets them.  When she presses the check button, it toggle a line through that item
  Scope: How we will generate the container in the dom.
  API:
  Pseudo code
    - clicking check button will trigger a toggle an item's check state through toggleChecked()
    - toggleCheck function will toggle a line-though the selected list item container's item name 
    - Render the updated list containers
  LOE: 20mins
  Risks: The default behavior of the button. 


3. permanently remove items from the list
  Story: Sally wants the ability to remove items off her shopping list
  Scope: How it will interact with other containers. So, the selected item 
  container will be removed from the page.  And any remaining containers will be redisplayed.
  API:
  Pseudo code
    - clicking deleteButton will trigger an event function that deletes the item container
    - the deleteItem function will remove the selected item container and re-render the 
    - remaining item list containers
  LOE: 20
  Risk:  WILL THE remaining item containers be displayed property 

4. (added) Remove example containers on initial load

# Code/functions:

// State Object/Functions
  var state = {
  	items: [
  		{title:"apples", checked: false, id: 27	},
  		{title:"oranges", checked: false}, id: 34}
  		],
        counter: 0  // use to generate a unique item id
  }

  findItem() // finds items in state object by comparing clicked list item data-id to state itemâ€™s id

// Render Functions
  renderItems()
  	//clears existing containers from DOM
  	//renders active list item containers

// Event Listener Functions
  addItem()  // adds new list item container
  toggleChecked()  // toggles the selected list item's name with a line-through
  deleteItem()    // deletes the selected item from the state item array


Additional Requirements/Constraints:

- You must use a CDN-hosted version of jQuery
- Put your application code in a file called app.js and link to it in index.html
- Be sure to put both script elements at the bottom of the <body> element.
- Do not alter index.html or main.css other than adding the links to the external JavaScript. Write JavaScript code that works with the existing HTML and CSS to implement the required features.
- Hint: you may find it helpful to read up on and use the following jQuery methods: .submit(), preventDefault(), toggleClass(), and closest
