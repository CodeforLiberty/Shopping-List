   function to listen for the submit event (preventDefault)
   get the value from the input

// Additionally:

// You must use a CDN-hosted version of jQuery
// Put your application code in a file called app.js and link to it in index.html
// Be sure to put both script elements at the bottom of the <body> element.
// Do not alter index.html or main.css other than adding the links to the external JavaScript. Write JavaScript code that works with the existing HTML and CSS to implement the required features.
// Hint: you may find it helpful to read up on and use the following jQuery methods: .submit(), preventDefault(), toggleClass(), and closest

What does the state look like?
var state = {
	items: [
		{title:"apples", checked: false	},
		{title:"oranges", checked:false},

		]
}

var render = function(){
	//clears existing containers from DOM
	//renders active list item containers
}
